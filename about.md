## About the Data Science Lab

The **Data Science Research Lab** at the University of Bristol explores both fundamental and applied challenges in extracting insight from data. Our team brings together expertise in areas such as **machine learning**, **time series analysis**, **bioinformatics**, and **natural language processing**, developing innovative methods for analysing, interpreting, and learning from complex data across diverse domains.

We work across the full data pipeline — from acquisition and curation to modelling and inference — advancing the frontiers of data-centric research.

The Data Science Lab is part of the [Intelligent Systems Laboratory](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/groups/intelligent-systems/) at the University of Bristol.
