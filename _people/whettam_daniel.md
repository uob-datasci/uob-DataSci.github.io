I'm a PhD student in the Interactive AI CDT at Bristol, working on Computer Vision in Dima Damen's group. 
Prior to my PhD I did an MSc at The University of Edinburgh in Data Science, and a BSc in Computer Science at The University of Hull.
My current research areas lie within self-supervised and multi-modal learning for action recognition in video.
