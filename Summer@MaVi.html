        <p class="major">Applicants will be selected based on their academic excellence, previous experiences and provided references. We have a limited number of 10 positions throughout the program annually</p>
<p class="major">You are expected to be in Bristol for the majority of your visit's duration. During your research visit, you will be supervised by your selected faculty member, and integrated within their research group. 
   <!-- You will have access to our excellent resource of GPUs (Blue Crystal 4) to run any experiments, a university of bristol email account with access to our PGR resources and a desk allocated for the duration of your visit. --> </p>
<p class="major">Additionally, you will have opportunities to present your work and attend talks by the various MaVi researchers. A social program over weekends will give you the opportunity to explore Bristol and its surroundings, guided by one of our friendly PGR students.  
Note that any expenses for the social activities are not covered by the program.  
Note that you need to bring your own laptop – machines will not be provided as part of the program. </p>
