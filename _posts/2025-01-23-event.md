Abstract:
This presentation combines insights from four distinct research efforts to examine critical aspects of neural networks across diverse domains. First, we explore the double descent phenomenon in nascent neural network architectures, demonstrating how training conditions and model architecture influence generalisation performance. Next, we address the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under radiation-induced errors, proposing novel activation functions and pooling layers to enhance reliability in mission-critical environments. Additionally, we present a method leveraging large language models (LLMs) with Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) prompting for automating policy evidence collection. Lastly, using Isambard-AI, we investigate skin tone bias in convolutional neural networks.  The models are trained to predict diagnosis from skin cancer image archives. Despite balancing the dataset, significant bias remains, emphasising the need for deeper analysis when using neural networks for health applications. Together, these findings highlight model architecture, environmental conditions, and ethical considerations when advancing neural network applications and motivate further research into model performance, reliability, and fairness.
