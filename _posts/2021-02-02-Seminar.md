Abstract: Images and videos allow us to capture and share memorable moments of our lives. However, 2D images and videos appear flat due to the lack of depth perception. In this talk, I will present our recent efforts to overcome these limitations. Specifically, I will cover our recent work for creating compelling 3D photography, estimating consistent video depth for advanced video-based visual effects, and free-viewpoint videos. I will conclude the talk with some ongoing research and research challenges ahead.
