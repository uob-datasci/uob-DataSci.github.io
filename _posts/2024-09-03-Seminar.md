Abstract: Computer vision (CV) has a broad range of applications that help us overcome the spatial and temporal constraints limiting human observation. One technology that addresses spatial constraints is free-viewpoint image generation, which creates images as if captured from positions where a camera cannot physically be placed. This technique uses 3D models reconstructed through 3D vision technologies, allowing images to be rendered from any viewpoint using computer graphics (CG). The emergence of NeRF has significantly revitalized research in this area.
On the other hand, overcoming temporal constraints involves sensing and recognizing rapidly changing objects and accurately presenting their temporal dynamics. Sensing technologies for moving objects is crucial in this context, with the recent focus on advanced cameras such as event cameras.
In this talk, I will explore the history and latest developments in free-viewpoint image generation based on 3D vision technologies, as well as CV technologies that utilize event cameras for capturing high-speed phenomena, while also presenting examples from my recent research in these fields.
